# /web/

Web pages in a project can be downloaded by http-get.
An example is given here.
When your browser acquires a page in http://host:port/web/ by http-get, ImonCloud serves corresponding files from /web/ in the project.
The web pages can be either html format or any other file type. You will download a file if the acquiring file format cannot be rendered by browser. 

# /lib/

Web pages in ImonCloud can also be downloaded by http-get.
When your browser acquires a page in http://host:port/lib/ by http-get, ImonCloud serves corresponding files from /lib/ in ImonCloud.
